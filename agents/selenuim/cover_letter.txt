Dear {company_name},

I am writing to express my interest in the {position_title}. I am a software developer with skills in Python, Java, and full-stack development, and I have experience working on innovative projects in AI and cybersecurity.

As a Computer Programming Instructor at Sunspark College, I created and taught courses on programming and problem-solving. During my internship at Colman Dev Club, I worked on React-based projects to improve web applications.

For my degree project, I developed Deceptify, which combines AI and cybersecurity using pre-trained models for social engineering scenarios. In another project, I used CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and AWS to build and deploy secure applications.

I am excited to bring my skills to {company_name} and would be happy to discuss how I can contribute to your goals.

Sincerely,
Aviv Nataf
